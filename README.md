# Haynes-Shockley experiment
> The Charge mobility in semiconductor materials
## goals
- Minority charge carriers amount.
- The effect of the distance between electrodes on the specimen in the production of electrons and holes.
- Measuring of carrier’s lifetime.

***Photo electric effect (laser beam) causes the drift mobility of minority charge carriers sweeps length of the semiconductor.***

Important fields: ***lifetime, drift velocity, electric field***

<h2>Measurement of drift velocity</h2>
<p>
E<sub>s</sub> is an internal electric pulse field that produced by a pulsed generator. Distance between optical fiber and needle (<ins>point contact</ins>) is d. V<sub>s</sub> is the electrical pulls and V<sub>l</sub> is the laser pulls. The laser pulls causes 2 small peak between up and down main semiconductor peak. The
second peak is the wider and relevant to minority carriers. 
<mark/>V<sub>d</sub> = <pre xml:lang="latex">x/y</pre> </mark>(<span>&#247;</span>) 

is the drift velocity.

## LaTeX

Upmath converts LaTeX equations in double-dollars `$$`: $$ax^2+bx+c=0$$. All equations are rendered as block equations. If you need inline ones, you can add the prefix `\inline`: $$\inline p={1\over q}$$. Place big equations on separate lines:

$$x_{1,2} = {-b\pm\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a}.$$
