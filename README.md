# Haynes-Shockley-experiment
The Charge mobility in semiconductor materials
## goals
- Minority charge carriers amount.
- The effect of the distance between electrodes on the specimen in the production of electrons and holes.
- Measuring of carrierâ€™s lifetime.

***Photo electric effect (laser beam) causes the drift mobility of minority charge carriers sweeps length of the semiconductor.***

Important fields: ***lifetime, drift velocity, electric field***

## Measurement of drift velocity
E<sub>s</sub> is an internal electric pulse field that produced by a pulsed generator. Distance between optical fiber and needle (point contact) is d. V<sub>s</sub> is the electrical pulls and V<sub>l</sub> is the laser pulls. The laser pulls causes 2 small peak between up and down main semiconductor peak. The
second peak is the wider and relevant to minority carriers. V<sub>d</sub> = d/t is the drift velocity.
