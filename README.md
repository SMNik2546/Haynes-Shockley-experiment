# Haynes-Shockley-experiment
The Charge mobility in semiconductor materials
## goals
- Minority charge carriers amount.
- The effect of the distance between electrodes on the specimen in the production of electrons and holes.
- Measuring of carrierâ€™s lifetime.

***Photo electric effect (laser beam) cause drift mobility of minority charge carriers sweeps length of the semiconductor.***

Important fields: ***lifetime, drift velocity, electric field***

## Measurement of drift velocity
E_s is an internal electric pulse field that produced by a pulsed generator.
